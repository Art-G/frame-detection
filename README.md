# Frame Detection

Frame Detection is a Python script that looks for similar frames between videos and gives you chapters based on those frames.

It has been built to identify opening credits for example on every video of a season.

Note: It only has meaning if the opening is the same on every video.

## Usage

Currently you can clone the repositoy and execute the script in your terminal

Use `-i` to provide the path of the video directory.

```shell
> python3 frame-detection/index.py -i videos/path
```
